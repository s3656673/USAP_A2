INTRODUCTION
------------

The l3d c0nfigurat0r program is used to control the detected LEDs on the system. For example, it can configure the keyboard LEDs, and even the hard drive LEDs.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

A debian based version of linux will work properly with this program. Ubuntu and Raspbian are two tested operating systems that this program will work on.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Make sure that the ledScript and bgScript are able to be executed with a "chmod u+x" command. Also, the LEDs can only be manipulated in root, therefore, before running the ledScript, run the terminal in root first.

The script does not require any additional configuration and will work right out-of-the-box, however, if there are any modifications you wish to do to the code, you are more than welcome.
